                        <p>The goal of the Capstone project is to develop a food delivery service, called HOMELY CUISINE, that is hosted as a web application specifically for delivering home-cooked meals. HOMELY CUISINE was developed by Thunkable (no code platform). This application will give at-home chefs the ability to create a HOMELY CUISINE cook account and post a list of home-cooked meals as a menu. Customers can make a HOMELY CUISINE customer account to view and order meals from the application</p>
                        <p>I developed it using the No Code Platform- “THUNKABLE” <br> Thunkable is a revolutionary platform that has simplified app and game development for a large number of creators and entrepreneurs</p>
